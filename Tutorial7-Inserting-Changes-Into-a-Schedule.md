### How to insert changes into a project schedule
- Inserting Changes
  - Make sure the project has been baselined before inserting the changes so that you can see the impact on the finish dates
  - Find the logical place in the schedule to insert the changes
  - Create a heading for your changes and label it appropriately - perhaps "Change #99 - Description of change"
  - Add the inserted task under the new Change heading
  - Connect the new task(s) with the existing activities using predecessor/successor links
    - ___Best Practice:___ Do NOT add links to activity headings
  - Take note of the finish date variance and analyze activities to recover the schedule by compressing or accelerating the schedule
  - ___Best Practice:___ changes that impact the schedule, cost, quality, and/or scope should be presented and reviewed for approval through a formal change management process.
  - Some PMs like to move the project changes under a "Change Orders" heading at the bottom of the schedule tasks. Each change, e.g., "Change #99 - change description", becomes a sub-heading change request with all its associated tasks under the "Change Orders" heading
