### How to name project files for updating, recovery, and changes
- Naming Convention
  - Project plan updates:
    - Naming convention: Month # - Project Name - Update - Date.mpp
    - Example:    
      1 - ERP Migration - Update - 5 March 2022.mpp
    - Explanation: This Project file represents the month #1 update that was assessed on 5 March 2022
  - Project plan recoveries
    - Naming convention: Month # - Project Name - Recovery - Date.mpp
    - Example:  
      1 - ERP Migration - Recovery - 5 March 2022.mpp
      - Explanation: This Project file represents the plan of record that recovered the schedule after the month #1 update that was assessed on 5 March 2022
    - You will only have a recovery if your project falls behind schedule
  - Project plan narratives
    - Naming convention: Month # - Project Name - Narrative - Date.doc
    - Example:  
      1 - ERP Migration - Narrative - 5 March 2022.mpp
      - Explanation: This Word document describes the highlights of the first month of the project -- in this case the February highlights. It should include any significant schedule misses and the related changes that were made to recover the project.
  - Project plan change orders
    - Naming convention: Month # - Project Name - CO Number - Date.mpp
    - Example:  
      2 - ERP Migration - CO No 1 - 12 April 2022.mpp
      - Explanation: a change order that was proposed after the second month of the project on April 12 after the schedule was updated on April 2
