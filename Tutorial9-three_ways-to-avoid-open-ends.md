### Three Ways to Avoid Open Ends
- Every task except the first, last, and headings should have a predecessor(s) and a successor(s)
- 1. visually inspect the Gantt Chart
  - Scanning the chart will point out any __obvious__ tasks that be missing connecting links
  - However, it is easy to miss a task without links especially in more complex projects.
- 2. insert a "Successors" column into your Gantt Chart entry screen table and search/scan for empty cells in the inserted column
  - Or for more complex projects, filter (press the down arrow) on the "Successors" column for blanks, i.e., `(Blank)`.
- 3. Go the Network Diagram and visually inspect for tasks without links
